# htmlgraphpaper
A (mostly) full-page grid, intended as a quick way to get "graph paper" on overhead projectors (for classroom use, etc) 
like Smartboards.

It is entirely self-contained in one file. No external Javascript libraries or CSS files required, so it should be usable off-line 
if you download a local copy.

The idea for this came from one day I needed to sketch on a Smartboard for one of my classes. I was able to kludge a grid by finding
an online PDF intended for printing graph paper on-demand and magnifying it. Hopefully this is a slightly-more-refined solution.
